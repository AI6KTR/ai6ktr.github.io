Known as AI6, it is a structured study group organised in 50+ cities across the globe, including Bangalore, Lagos, Toronto, Singapore and Sunnyvale. It is community-driven and free-to-attend.

AI Saturdays (AI6) is catalysed by Nurture.AI. The first cycle of AI6 began in January 2018 and ended in May 2018. Over 5,000 participants from 50 cities worldwide were part of the AI6 movement. 

Therefore, I thought of starting a chapter at Kattankulathur.
