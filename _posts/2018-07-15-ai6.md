Known as AI6, it is a structured study group organised in 50+ cities across the globe, including Bangalore, Lagos, Toronto, Singapore and Sunnyvale. It is community-driven and free-to-attend.

AI Saturdays (AI6) is catalysed by <a href="https://nurture.ai/" target="_blank">nurture.ai</a>, an AI start-up from Singapore. The first cycle of AI6 began in January 2018 and ended in May 2018. Over 5,000 participants from 50 cities worldwide were part of the AI6 movement including Bangalore, Lagos, Toronto, Singapore and Sunnyvale and now we are bringing it to **Kattankulathur**.

On successful completion of the course along with assignments and projects, you will recieve a certificate from nurture.ai. Everything's free of cost.

### What will I learn?

* You'll learn about AI in a group via online MOOCs like Fast.AI / Deep Learning Specialization / Standford Computer Vision (CS231n).
* Get a structured lesson plan with deadlines.
* Learn by coding AI projects - our lesson plans come with hands-on coding assignments.
* Participate in <a href="(https://ai6forums.nurture.ai/)" target="_blank">AI6 forums</a>

### Who can join?

Anyone who is interested in AI can join as long as they can attend weekly meetups held in Kattankulathur. AI6's participants range from complete beginners to people who have mastered deep learning through online courses and lecture videos, Kaggle masters, Fast.ai Fellows and people with Masters and PhDs from top universities like Stanford, Harvard, Oxford, to complete beginners in AI - there's something for everyone.

### Lesson Plan

We plan to meet every Saturday (except during exams!) this semester.
