AI Saturdays (or AI6) is a community-driven, non-profit and global movement to make Artificial Intelligence education with the quality and rigor of the world's best universities accessible to anyone for free.

It is catalysed by [Nurture.AI](https://nurture.ai/ "Nurture.AI's Homepage"). The first cycle of AI6 began in January 2018 and ended in May 2018. Over 5,000 participants from 50 cities worldwide were part of the AI6 movement including Bangalore, Lagos, Toronto, Singapore and Sunnyvale and now we are bringing it to Kattankulathur.

### What will I do?

* Study AI in a group via online MOOCs like Fast.AI / Deep Learning Specialization / Standford Computer Vision (CS231n).
* Get a structured lesson plan with deadlines.
* Learn by coding AI projects - our lesson plans come with hands-on coding assignments.
* Participate in [AI6 Forums](https://ai6forums.nurture.ai/) and get help and motivation from the community.
* Have fun while learning with your peers / classmates / friends!

### Who can join?

AI6's participants range from complete beginners to people who have mastered deep learning through online courses and lecture videos, Kaggle masters, Fast.ai Fellows and people with Masters and PhDs from top universities like Stanford, Harvard, Oxford, to complete beginners in AI - there's something for everyone.
